# Backstroke Classic
A Github bot to keep a fork updated with any changes made to its upstream.
Heavily inspired by Greenkeeper.

*NOTE*: This is an old, deprecated version of Backstroke. Check out the latest here: [backstroke.us](https://backstroke.us).

## Add Backstroke Classic to a repository
1. Create a webhook in either a fork or a upstream repository. (`Settings` => `Webhooks & Services` => `Add Webhook`)
3. Add `http://backstroke.us` as the payload url.
4. Create the webhook, and push some code to the upstream repository to see Backstroke in action.
